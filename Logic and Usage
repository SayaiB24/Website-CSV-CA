LOGIC FOR ROOM ALLOCATION :-

1. Read and Parse CSV Files:
- Read the Group Information CSV and parse it into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a group 
  with keys: Group ID, Members, and Gender.
- Read the Hostel Information CSV and parse it into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a room 
  with keys: Hostel Name, Room Number, Capacity, and Gender.

2.Sort and Group Data:
- Sort the group data by Members in descending order to allocate larger groups first.
- Sort the hostel data by Capacity in descending order to fill larger rooms first.

3.Allocation Algorithm:
- Initialize an empty list to keep track of the room allocations.
- Iterate over each group and attempt to allocate them to a room:
- Find the first available room in the hostel data that matches the group's gender and has enough capacity.
- If a suitable room is found, allocate the group to the room, reduce the room's remaining capacity, and record the allocation.
- If no single room can accommodate the entire group, attempt to split the group into smaller subgroups and allocate
  them to multiple rooms while maintaining the gender and capacity constraints.

4.Handle Special Cases:
- If groups with mixed genders (e.g., 5 Boys & 3 Girls) are present, they should be split and allocated to respective boys' 
  and girls' hostels.

5.Output Results:
- Display the allocated rooms indicating which group members are in which room.
- Provide a downloadable CSV file with the allocation details.

USAGE :-
1.Upload CSV Files:
- Users upload the group and hostel information CSV files through the form.

2.Run Allocation Algorithm:
- The backend processes the files, runs the allocation algorithm, and generates the allocation results.

3.Display and Download Results:
- The results are displayed on the webpage, and users can download the allocation details as a CSV file.
